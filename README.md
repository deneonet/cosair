# Cosair Engine

A 2D Game Engine, written in C++, following ["The Cherno's Game Engine Series"](https://thecherno.com/engine) with own modifications, like:

- Materials
- Transforms
- API Changes
- Texture Library
- Better error handling (texture fallbacks, fragment shader fallbacks)

## Try it
- Clone this repo
- Run `win-generate.bat` inside `scripts`
- Go back & Open the Solution file
- Hit Run
- Build fails first time, just run it again (i'm going to fix this)
- Play Flappybird
